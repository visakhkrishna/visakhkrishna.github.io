                <p>In this blogpost, I briefly describe the IQT project that I am currently developing along with my colleague at <mark>SYSTRA</mark>, Sweden. I simplify it in the following sections </p>

                <!-- images -->

                <h2>What is IQT?</h2>
                <h4>IQT is our mobile & web-based digital application that can be used to record inspections and send a report to the asset owner for their business requirements.</h4>

                <p>This is a part of our ongoing drive towards digitalisation of asset maintenance activities in the railway sector in Sweden. It has been developed after extensive survey of various stakeholders in the Swedish rail industry such as inspectors, asset-owners and maintainers.</p>

                <p>The workflow is simple and easy to use. It consists of three components as described in the figure</p>

                <p>The results of the inspection can then be viewed on the web application with options to edit and report it to the asset owner. A parallel workflow also relays the well-annotated results for detailed analytics through APIs.</p> -->

                                
                <h2>Why are we making it and who is it for?</h2>
                <h3>Plan Do Check Act.. *Better*</h3>
                <p>For industries with large and safety-critical assets such as the railway industry, quality management services are a vital part of the life-cycle activities.  We follow the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55088.html" style="text-decoration:underline">ISO55000</a>-recommended PDCA cycle for continuous improvement in our asset management activities to realize maximum value from our assets. </p>

                <p>For a complex asset as a railway vehicle with 100s of components to check, going around with a notepad isn't going to cut it exactly. There is a need for an inspection tool that is mindful about the asset complexity, make it easier to register inspections, and also report it to the asset owner in a simple manner. With this vision in mind, the original application was developed for the PC by our team of ISO9000-certified rolling stock specialists and has been in use for more than a decade in Sweden. With the latest iteration we are just making it better and <em>data-ready</em>.</p>
              
                <h3>Your inspection data is more important than you think</h3>
                What do we mean by data-ready? It simply means the preparedness and quality of data that can aid clear decision-making. It includes amongst other things such as data accuracy, completeness, timeliness, consistency, and accessibility. A well-labelled data collection system for an asset is crucial if you want the inspection to mean something beyond its completion. 

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> A well-labelled data collection system for an asset is crucial if you want the inspection to mean something beyond its completion.<span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Accumulating several inspections of the asset can help us create a digital picture of its life cycle and with every iteration get better at anticipating its maintenance requirements. In other words, it can be used to find patterns and tune maintenance activities. Well-labelled and accessible data forms the fundamental block towards building a digital twin. IQT is specifically tailored towards this requirement.</p>

                <p>Such a tool can be useful for anyone in the industry who own, operate or maintain railway assets such as fleet-owners, rolling stock manufacturers, maintainers, infrastructure owners, railway consultancies, etc.</p>
